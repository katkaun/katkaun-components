# My Component Library Playground ðŸš§

This is my personal playground for building reusable UI components using **React** and **Storybook**. It's a work in progress where I explore new ideas and refine components that I can use across projects.

## Features

- **Reusable Components**: Modular, customizable UI components.
- **Storybook Integration**: View and test components interactively with Storybook.
- **Modern Tooling**: Built with React, Vite, and CSS Modules.

## Getting Started

### Running Storybook

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/katkaun/katkaun-components.git
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start Storybook:
    npm run storybook
    ```
